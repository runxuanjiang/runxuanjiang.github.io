            <p>
                I am an undergraduate researcher at the University of Michigan Computer Science and Engineering department, where I am fortunate to be advised by professor <a href="https://ambujtewari.github.io/" target="_blank">Ambuj Tewari</a>.
                I am also working with professor <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/zimmerman-lab/author/paulzim/" target="_blank"> Paul Zimmerman </a> in exploring the applications of RL
                in computational chemistry.
                My current work is in reinforcement learning (RL), and how it can be applied to the conformer generation problem. 
                Specifically, I am interested in exploring models that involve hierarchical RL, and multi-agent RL and their effectiveness in conformer generation.
                I am also investigating how deep learning methods - particularly transfer and curriculum learning - can be used to improve training, 
                as well as how modifications to graph neural network and attention network architectures can improve agent performance.
